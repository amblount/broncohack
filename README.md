## Inspiration
We wanted to use technology to make a direct impact on the homeless community. A way to do this is to increase homelessness attendance at food and homeless shelters.

## What it does
Our platform allows for you to conveniently donate using your iphones and transfers your donation to a shelter where the homeless person can then come to pick up cash.
